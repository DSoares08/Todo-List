# Todo-List

A simple and minimal todo list application. It allows the user to register and login. In the dashboard, the user can create, update, and delete tasks.

## Problem

Most todo list applications have excessive tools which can distract the actual purpose. The goal was to make something simple for people to use.

## Steps

Firstly, the login UI and logic was created. In order to persist the user information I used a firebase database. Later, the dashboard was made along with the CRUD functionality. There is a component for individual todos and a hook method to fetch them.

## Decisions

The main decision was to choose a font that is appealing to the eye and suitable for the app. For that, I chose one from Google fonts.

Icons also needed to be picked to fit with the overall design of the app.

## Summary

In conclusion, this project was a great way to familiarize myself with full-stack using React.
